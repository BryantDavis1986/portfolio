          <div data-animate="fadeInUp" class="col-lg-6">
            <p>I have grown up in tech my entire life. Whether it was looking over my mom’s shoulder when she worked at Microsoft, learning HTML on notepad and dreamweaver in high school. All the way to learning computer logic and c++ in the Marine Corps. To this day, I still strive to learn technologies and languages in the world of software engineering.</p>

             <p> Speaking of the Marine Corps, I am a Marine Corps veteran. I served 8 years as an Aviation Operations Specialist and during that time I spent 3.5 years in the middle east. As part of my job I was responsible for utilizing complex systems that tracked and ensured the reliability and operability of every component on multiple Marine Corps fixed wing aircraft.
            </p>
             <p> As a non-commissioned officer and the operations chief I was trained and assigned to proficiently lead a team of 11 Marines to help accomplish this mission. I analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of my teammates and delegated tasks and responsibilities accordingly to increase efficiency when accomplishing a task.
            </p>
             <p>As for my future career, being a good software engineer is not the only thing I strive to be but uplifting and motivating teammates around me is one of my highest priorities.
            </p>
             <p> I am a master at operating and delivering in high stress, fast paced environments, and am at my best when working in teams and collaborating ideas with others. All my experiences have led me to today, to what I hope to be is an amazing career in tech. whether that opportunity is near or far. I’m excited to take on the challenges head on that it will bring.
            </p>
              <p>I am looking for a position as a Full Stack Software Engineer, Backend Software Engineer, FrontEnd Software Engineer to hone my craft that will continue to let me grow and challenge me..</p>

                <p>Bryant Davis was a great individual to have on my team. He was very conscientious about his work and professional relationships. He can be relied on to take on any task that is given and to take initiative where appropriate and his results always add value to the organization. I would gladly have him on any of my teams or recommend him for anyone else’s team.</p>

                <p>I worked with Bryant in the Operations Department of an operational aviation unit in the United States Marine Corps. I was his direct supervisor. Despite his junior rank at the time, I handpicked Bryant to manage multiple programs. More often than not, Bryant met or surpassed my expectations. Bryant didn't just manage programs, he looked for ways to improve them at the institutional level. His expertise and knowledge of aviation operations positively impacted multiple facets of a successful Operations Department.</p>

                <p>Bryant Davis is, in my opinion and experience, a competent software developer and team mate!

                  I've gone through three courses with him at CodeFellows and worked on a project together. He's a stickler for rules and test-driven development and has quite a sense of humor.
                  
                  Displays a passion for writing stable, secure, and scalable code and is a pleasure to work with.
                  
                  If you're lucky enough to have him on your team, he's got your back. I still remember those nights where he would finish his work and jump to my desk to help me trouble shoot my blockers, often times we'd work through midnight. The guy's commitment and work ethic are commendable!.</p>

Bryant was consistently staying online after hours to help other fellow students (including myself). He is passionate about writing optimal scripts as he has an innate ability to expose bugs that most eyes would never notice. Bryant is a strong developer and an even stronger learner.</p>

                  He is a gifted software developer who is good at what he does and is a team player who is a natural leader.
                  
                  If given the opportunity, I would eagerly work with Bryant on any coding project. I believe that he will be an exceptional addition to any prospecting company in the near future.

                <p>Bryant is an exceptionally bright and creative programmer. Throughout the several months we studied together at Code Fellows Bryant was constantly growing as both a developer and a team member. He possesses a high degree of creative problem solving ability as well as a general aptitude for learning the ins and outs of any language he's approached. I would not hesitate to work professionally with Bryant, I think he is not only an asset in terms of his technical abilities but also in terms of his growth mindset and drive to improve himself as a developer and as an individual.</p>
